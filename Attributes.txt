Attributes
===========

What : in a built in class

Why : to give additional info at runtime

Where to use : Attribute is used before class, variable, method and anywhere, to add additional info

[Serializable]
public class Book

Built-in 

User defined



Beep Function
---------------

Its a built in function of the Windows Operating System

We have to import [DllImport("kernel32.dll")]

dll extension is the reusable code


Create your own attribute
==========================

[Attribute Usage, MultipleUsage = true]
Create a Class DebugInfo : Attribute   ---------- Inherit from attribute class


It can be applied to Class, Constructor, Field(Like Variables), Method, Property

AllowMultiple usage = true

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                     OBSELETE 
                                                 ----------------

When we will use obselete, it will not run, since the version may be obselete.


internal class Class2
{
   [Obsolete]
   public void Function1()
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Function1");
   }
 
   public void Function2()
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Function2");
   }
}

Class2 obj = new Class2();
obj.Function1();
obj.Function2();

                                                 Reflection
                                               _______________

Structures
============

A structure is used to a value type variable (variable of value types)
A variable which can hold many values of different datatypes

struct OrderDetails
{
	int orderid;
	string productname;
	float price;
	}

- structure can be created inside class or outside class
- structure can have variables, functions, events
- It can hold value of different types

In structure everything is public by default


** Diff b/w structure and class

Ans) In Copy

                                           Enum
                                        ----------


A fixed set of constant values

A programmer can pick a particular value.

Enum can be created anywhere.

It can be used outside the class, then other classes can also access it.

If used inside the class, then only that class can use it.
